# Documentation
This is the documentation of the STRAWb-package but also the related infrastructure like ONC and LRZ.

**ONC** hosts a database (DB) with all data from the measurements of the deployed modules.

**LRZ** provides a storage system called DSS and a VM (virtual machine) hosting services (Compute Cloud). The DSS holds a daily synced copy of all files of the ONC DB related to STRAWb.

Please also have a look to the [repository's readme](./README.md) with information about installing the package and more.
